# Feather UI

Feather is a universal UI library that only mutates application state in response to user inputs or events, using functional reactive event streams, and maps application state to a layout using persistent functions, which then efficiently render only the parts of the UI that changed using either a standard GPU compositor or custom shaders.

## Building

Feather is a standard rust project, simply run `cargo build` on your platform of choice. A NixOS flake is included that provides a develop environment for nix developers who do not have rust installed system-wide.

## Running

Examples can be found in `feather-ui/examples`, and can be run via `cargo run --example [example_name]`. 

If you are on NixOS, use `nix run github:Fundament-Software/feathergui#[example_name]`
If you are not on nixos but have nix, use `nix run --impure github:nix-community/nixGL -- nix run github:fundament-software/feathergui#[example_name]`  

The examples have currently only been tested on NixOS and Windows 11, but should work on most systems.
